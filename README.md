# Inferring single- and multi-species distributional aggregation using quadrat sampling

## Data and Code Availability

###  Data
Best fitted SAR models (Kissling & Carl, 2008) predicting Sørensen-based multi-site dissimilarity (βsor) and its underlying true turnover (βsim) and nestedness (βsne) components for Chinese Lauraceae. R codes and data used for SAR analysis are given here to ensure reproducibility.

###  Code
Distribution maps calculated by ensembles of small models (ESMs, Breiner et al., 2015, 2018) for all species.  Binary map generated by ESMs and the continuous suitability maps produced by ESMs and the four algorithms, namely generalized linear model (GLM), classification tree analysis (CTA), 
artificial neural networks (ANN), maximum entropy (MAXENT) are displaying for each species.
